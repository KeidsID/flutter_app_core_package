  ///
  /// When the server responds with a `506 Variant Also Negotiates` status code,

  ///
  /// In that specification a client may send a request that contains an

  ///
  /// Network operators sometimes require some authentication, acceptance of
  /// terms, or other user interaction before granting access
  /// (for example in an internet caf√© or at an airport). They often identify
  /// clients who have not done so using their Media Access Control (MAC)
  /// addresses.
